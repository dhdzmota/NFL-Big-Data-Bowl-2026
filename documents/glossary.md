## Fully Connected Graph
A graph representation in which every player is connected to every other player within a given frame. In this project, edges are weighted by inverse distance, meaning closer players exert stronger relational influence. This structure ensures that no potential interaction is ignored before filtering to the most meaningful spatial relationships.

## Louvain Community Detection
A graph-based algorithm used to identify emergent clusters of interaction by maximizing modularity. Here, it is applied frame by frame to proximity networks to uncover groups of players that are spatially and dynamically coupled. These communities represent localized zones of interaction where dominance exchanges are most intense.

## Dominance Field
A continuous spatial influence surface generated by an individual player at a given frame. It encodes how that player’s physical state, orientation, and movement shape the surrounding playable space. The field is modeled as an anisotropic Gaussian aligned with the player’s direction of motion and scaled by a mechanically informed amplitude.

## Dominance Index
A scalar summary metric derived from a player’s local dominance field. It measures the proportion of nearby space (within a fixed radius) that is aligned with the player’s team intent (offense or defense). The Dominance Index captures both individual presence and interaction effects, producing a value between 0 and 1 that evolves frame by frame.

## Kinetic Energy
A physics-derived proxy representing the capacity for movement-driven impact, computed from player mass and speed. Within this framework, kinetic energy contributes to the mechanical amplitude of the dominance field, reflecting how forcefully a player can project influence through motion.

## Momentum
A mass–velocity quantity capturing a player’s movement persistence and resistance to disruption. In the Dominance framework, momentum helps distinguish players who are merely fast from those whose motion meaningfully constrains opponents and space.

## Force
A mass–acceleration proxy representing a player’s capacity to initiate or respond to rapid changes in motion. This component emphasizes explosive actions such as cuts, bursts, and reactions; that temporarily reshape dominance locally.

## Action
A time-integrated mechanical term combining mass, speed, and a short temporal horizon. It captures sustained mechanical engagement rather than instantaneous motion, rewarding players whose influence persists across multiple frames.

## Stability
A measure of alignment between body orientation and movement direction. High stability indicates purposeful, controlled motion, while low stability reflects transitional or reactive states. Stability modulates mechanical amplitude by rewarding coordinated, intentional movement.

## Cohesion
A measure of how well a player remains integrated within their local interaction community. High cohesion indicates synchronized movement with nearby teammates, reinforcing collective dominance. Low cohesion reflects isolation or structural weakness, reducing effective influence despite individual motion.
